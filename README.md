# Colors
## Description
Companies printing maps are always trying to save money by buying the smallest amount of ink cartridge: given a map, they want to know if it is possible to print the map with k colors.
Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and an integer k, is there a way to color the vertices with k colors such that adjacent vertices are colored differently?
## Task
Task: write an encoder for the Colors problem:
 - Input: a text file containing the graph and an integer k
 - Encode the problem into SAT
 - If unsatisfiable, output UNSATISFIABLE
 - If satisfiable, output the color associated with each node of the graph
